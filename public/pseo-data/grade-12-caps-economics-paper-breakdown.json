  "content": "# Grade 12 CAPS Economics: Paper 1 & Paper 2 Complete Guid\n\ne\n\n## Why Economics Separates Top Students\n\nEconomics requires **graph drawing**, **calculation precision**, and **conceptual understanding**. The jump from Grade 11 is significant—many students who coasted previously hit a wall.\n\n## Paper 1: Microeconomics & Macroeconomics (2 hours, 150 marks)\n\n| Section | Content | Marks | Graphs Required |\n|---------|---------|-------|----------------|\n\n| **Microeconomics** | Demand, supply, market equilibrium, elasticity | 50 | Demand/supply curves, elasticity calculations |\n| **Contemporary Issues** | Inflation, unemployment, poverty | 40 | Phillips curve, Lorenz curve |\n\n| **Markets** | Perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly | 30 | Cost curves, revenue curves |\n| **Public Sector** | Fiscal policy, budget analysis | 30 | Laffer curve, tax incidence |\n\n**Critical graphs you must draw perfectly:**\n\n1. **Demand and Supply:** Shifts vs movements along curves\n2. **Elasticity:** Price elasticity of demand (PED) calculations\n\n3. **Market Structures:** Perfect competition (horizontal demand) vs monopoly (downward sloping)\n4. **Phillips Curve:** Inflation-unemployment trade-off\n\n## Paper 2: Economic Growth & Development (2 hours, 150 marks)\n\n| Section | Content | Marks | South African Focus |\n|---------|---------|-------|--------------------|\n\n| **Economic Growth** | GDP, business cycles, indicators | 40 | SA GDP trends, recession analysis |\n| **Economic Development** | HDI, Millennium Goals, inequality | 40 | SA development challenges |\n\n| **International Trade** | Exchange rates, balance of payments, protectionism | 40 | Rand volatility, trade agreements |\n| **Globalization** | Multinationals, outsourcing, regional integration | 30 | SADC, AU, WTO membership |\n\n## The Calculation Component\n\nEconomics includes **mathematical questions** (15-20% of marks):\n\n| Calculation | Formula | Common Error |\n|-------------|---------|-------------|\n\n| **PED** | % change Qd ÷ % change P | Using wrong base for percentage |\n| **YED** | % change Qd ÷ % change Y | Inferior vs normal goods confusion |\n\n| **Real GDP** | (Nominal GDP ÷ GDP deflator) × 100 | Index number mistakes |\n| **Exchange rates** | Direct vs indirect quotes | Currency conversion direction |\n\n## StudyBuddy's Economics Graph & Calculation Tools\n\n**Graph drawing:**\n- \"Draw a perfect competition market in long-run equilibrium\"\n- \"Show the effect of a subsidy on supply and demand\"\n- \"Illustrate cost-push inflation vs demand-pull inflation\"\n\n**Calculations:**\n- \"Calculate PED when price rises from R10 to R12 and quantity falls from 100 to 80\"\n- \"If the exchange rate is R15/$, how many dollars for R3000?\"\n- \"Calculate real GDP given nominal GDP of R500bn and deflator of 120\"\n\n**Conceptual explanations:**\n- \"Explain why the demand curve slopes downward using substitution and income effects\"\n- \"Compare economic growth vs development with SA examples\"\n\n## South African Context Requirements\n\nCAPS Economics requires **current South African data**:\n- **GDP growth rate:** Recent trends (post-COVID recovery)\n- **Unemployment:** Official vs expanded definition\n- **Inflation:** CPI trends, Reserve Bank targets\n- **Exchange rate:** Rand volatility factors\n\n**StudyBuddy's SA data integration:** \"What's the current SA unemployment rate and how does it compare to BRICS countries?\"\n\n## 6-Week Economics Mastery Plan\n\n| Weeks | Paper 1 Focus | Paper 2 Focus |\n|-------|---------------|---------------|\n\n| 1-2 | Demand, supply, elasticity | GDP & growth concepts |\n| 3 | Market structures | Development indicators |\n\n| 4 | Public sector & fiscal policy | International trade |\n| 5 | Contemporary issues | Globalization & SA context |\n\n| 6 | Graph & calculation intensive | Full exam simulation |\n\n**Call to Action:**\n**Master economic graphs with step-by-step AI guidance →** [Link to StudyBuddy Economics tutor]\n\n**Internal Links:**\n- [Demand and supply: Shifts vs movements explained](#)\n- [South African economic indicators: Current data](#)\n- [Exchange rates: Rand volatility factors](#)",

  "quickAnswer": "Economics Paper 1: Microeconomics (50 marks—demand/supply/elasticity), Contemporary Issues (40 marks—inflation/unemployment), Markets (30 marks—perfect competition/monopoly), Public Sector (30 marks—fiscal policy). Paper 2: Economic Growth (40 marks—GDP/business cycles), Development (40 marks—HDI/inequality), International Trade (40 marks—exchange rates), Globalization (30 marks). Graph drawing is 30% of marks—perfect graphs are non-negotiable.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a shift and a movement along the demand curve?",
      "answer": "Movement along curve: Price change causes quantity demanded to change (move along same curve). Shift: Non-price factor changes (income, preferences), entire curve shifts left/right. Common mistake: Drawing a shift when question asks about price change."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)?",
      "answer": "Formula: PED = (% change in Qty Demanded) ÷ (% change in Price). Example: Price R10→R12 (20% increase), Qty 100→80 (20% decrease). PED = 20/20 = 1 (unitary elastic). If PED > 1: elastic, < 1: inelastic, = 1: unitary."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between economic growth and development?",
      "answer": "Growth: Increase in GDP (quantitative, measured in money). Development: Improvement in quality of life (qualitative, measured by HDI—health, education, income). SA can have GDP growth but poor development if inequality increases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the demand curve slope downward?",
      "answer": "Two reasons: (1) Substitution effect—higher price means consumers switch to substitutes, (2) Income effect—higher price reduces purchasing power, can buy less. Together, these cause inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do exchange rates work in Economics?",
      "answer": "Exchange rate: Price of one currency in another. Example: R15/$ means 1 dollar costs R15. If rand weakens to R18/$, SA exports become cheaper (good for exporters), imports more expensive (bad for consumers). Affects trade balance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can StudyBuddy help with Economics graph drawing?",
      "answer": "Yes. Ask 'Draw a supply and demand graph showing the effect of a tax' and StudyBuddy generates the graph with labels, shows curve shifts, and explains the outcome (higher price, lower quantity). Practice with unlimited graph variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What South African data do I need to know?",
      "answer": "CAPS requires current SA context: Unemployment rate (~32% official definition), GDP growth (recent trends), Inflation target (3-6% CPIX), Exchange rate volatility, Main trading partners (China, USA, EU), BRICS membership. StudyBuddy provides updated data."
