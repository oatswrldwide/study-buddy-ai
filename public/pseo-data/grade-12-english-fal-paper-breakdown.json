  "quickAnswer": "English FAL has 3 papers: Paper 1 (Comprehension, Visual Literacy, Summary, Language—2 hours), Paper 2 (Essay + Transactional Writing—2.5 hours), Paper 3 (Literature: Poetry, Novel, Drama—2.5 hours). You can't cram English—need strategy, not memorization. Paper 1 time management is critical: max 25 minutes on comprehension or you'll run out of time.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the biggest difference between English FAL and Home Language?",
      "answer": "FAL (First Additional Language) assumes English is your second language, so questions are simpler, texts are shorter, and marking is more lenient. Home Language has longer texts, more complex vocabulary, and expects deeper literary analysis. Both have 3 papers but FAL is less demanding."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I improve my Paper 1 comprehension score?",
      "answer": "3 strategies: (1) Read questions first to know what to look for, (2) Underline key words in questions (explain, identify, why), (3) Quote from the text to support answers—markers reward evidence. Don't spend more than 25 minutes on comprehension or you'll run out of time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between narrative and descriptive essays?",
      "answer": "Narrative: Tells a story with plot, characters, conflict, and resolution (has a beginning, middle, end). Descriptive: Paints a vivid picture of a person, place, or event using sensory details (no plot required). Narrative needs action, descriptive needs imagery."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I write a summary for full marks?",
      "answer": "Summary rules: (1) Exactly 60-70 words (markers count), (2) Use your own words—copying loses marks, (3) Include 7 key points from the text, (4) Write in full sentences, not bullet points, (5) No opinions or extra information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the most common transactional text formats?",
      "answer": "FAL Paper 2 offers 6 options: Formal letter, Informal letter, Speech, Review, Advertisement, Newspaper article. Each has a specific format (e.g., letter needs addresses, greeting, closing). Choose one you've practiced—don't experiment in the exam."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can StudyBuddy help with literature analysis?",
      "answer": "Yes. StudyBuddy analyzes prescribed texts (novels, plays, poems), explains themes, identifies literary devices, and generates practice questions. Upload any quote and ask \"Analyze this in context\" for exam-ready explanations with character, plot, and theme connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prepare for the unseen poem in Paper 3?",
      "answer": "Unseen poetry strategy: (1) Read the title and footnotes first, (2) Identify the speaker and situation, (3) Look for literary devices (metaphor, simile, personification), (4) Determine the mood/tone, (5) Connect form to meaning (why this stanza structure?). Practice with past papers."
