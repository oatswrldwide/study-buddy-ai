Most students are strong in one and weak in the other.\n\n## Paper 1: Essays & Extended Writing (3 hours, 150 marks)\n\n| Section | Format | Marks | Time |\n|---------|--------|-------|------|\n| **Section A:** | Three essays (choose 2) | 2 × 50 = 100 | 2 hours |\n| **Section B:** | Data response/interpretation | 50 | 1 hour |\n\n**Essay structure for full marks:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** Context + line of argument (thesis statement)\n2. **Paragraph 1:** Point + evidence + analysis + link to question\n3. **Paragraph 2:** Point + evidence + analysis + link to question\n4. **Paragraph 3:** Counter-argument + refutation\n5. **Conclusion:** Synthesis, not summary\n\n## Paper 2: Source-Based Questions (3 hours, 150 marks)\n\n| Skill Tested | Question Types | Marks |\n|--------------|----------------|-------|\n| **Source evaluation** | Reliability, usefulness, bias | 30 |\n| **Comparison** | Compare sources X and Y | 25 |\n| **Interpretation** | What does Source Z suggest? | 20 |\n| **Synthesis** | Using all sources + own knowledge | 35 |\n| **Paragraph/essay** | Mini-essay using sources | 40 |\n\n**Source analysis formula (OPCV):**\n- **O**rigin: Who created it?

  "quickAnswer": "Grade 12 History splits into Paper 1 (Extended writing: 2 essays at 50 marks each + data response at 50 marks) and Paper 2 (Source-based questions requiring analysis, comparison, synthesis). Paper 1 tests historical knowledge, Paper 2 tests source evaluation using OPCV method (Origin, Purpose, Content, Value/Limitation). Cold War, Apartheid, and Independent Africa dominate exam content.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Paper 1 and Paper 2 in History?",
      "answer": "Paper 1 tests historical knowledge through essays (you must know facts, dates, causes, consequences). Paper 2 tests source evaluation skills (analyzing documents, photos, cartoons for reliability and bias using the OPCV method). Paper 1 is content-heavy, Paper 2 is skills-based."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should a History essay be?",
      "answer": "Aim for 2-3 pages (about 500-600 words) for a 50-mark essay. Quality over quantity: a well-structured 2-page essay with clear argument and evidence scores higher than a rambling 4-page answer. Budget 45-50 minutes per essay including planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the OPCV method for source analysis?",
      "answer": "OPCV stands for Origin (who created it, when, why), Purpose (what the creator intended), Content (what it actually says/shows), Value/Limitation (how reliable/useful for historians). This framework ensures you analyze sources systematically for full marks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to memorize dates for History exams?",
      "answer": "You need key dates for context (e.g., 1948 apartheid begins, 1994 first democratic election) but not every minor event. Focus on sequences and periods (early 1960s, late apartheid era) rather than exact dates. Essays reward understanding of causation over date memorization."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I integrate 'own knowledge' with sources in Paper 2?",
      "answer": "After quoting/referencing a source, add context: 'Source A shows Mandela's arrest, which occurred during the Rivonia Trial in 1963 when ANC leaders were charged with sabotage.' This shows you understand the source IN CONTEXT, not just what it says."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can StudyBuddy help with History essay planning?",
      "answer": "Yes. StudyBuddy analyzes essay questions, suggests thesis statements, provides evidence from key events, and checks your essay structure. Upload your introduction and ask 'Is my line of argument clear?' for instant feedback before writing the full essay."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the hardest topic in Grade 12 History?",
      "answer": "The Cold War confuses many students due to multiple countries, ideologies, and proxy wars. Key strategy: Create a timeline of major events (Berlin Blockade, Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, détente) and understand the USA vs USSR ideological conflict as the thread connecting everything."
