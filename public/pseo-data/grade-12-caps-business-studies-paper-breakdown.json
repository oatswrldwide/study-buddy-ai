  "quickAnswer": "Business Studies Paper 1 covers Business Environments (PESTLE analysis—40 marks), Business Sectors (30 marks), Social Responsibility (30 marks), Creative Thinking (20 marks), Business Plans (30 marks). Paper 2 covers HR (40 marks), Marketing (40 marks), Operations (35 marks), Quality (35 marks). Both use lengthy case studies—success requires linking theory to scenarios, not just memorizing definitions.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Paper 1 and Paper 2?",
      "answer": "Paper 1 focuses on business environments (external factors like PESTLE), sectors, and social responsibility. Paper 2 focuses on business functions (internal operations: HR, Marketing, Operations, Quality). Paper 1 is about context, Paper 2 is about management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is PESTLE analysis and why is it important?",
      "answer": "PESTLE analyzes external factors: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental. It appears in every exam because businesses must adapt to these forces. Know examples: Political (government policy), Economic (interest rates), Social (demographics), etc."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I apply Maslow's Hierarchy in Business Studies?",
      "answer": "Maslow's pyramid: Physiological → Safety → Social → Esteem → Self-actualization. Apply to HR: Basic salary satisfies physiological needs, job security satisfies safety, teamwork satisfies social, promotions satisfy esteem, challenging work satisfies self-actualization. Always link theory to business scenario."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the 4Ps of Marketing?",
      "answer": "Product (what you sell), Price (what you charge), Place (where you sell), Promotion (how you advertise). Marketing mix questions ask you to analyze a business using all 4Ps. Example: Product (quality), Price (R50), Place (retail stores), Promotion (TV ads)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between TQM and SABS?",
      "answer": "TQM (Total Quality Management) is a philosophy: continuous improvement, customer focus, employee involvement. SABS (South African Bureau of Standards) is certification: products meet safety/quality standards. TQM is internal culture, SABS is external validation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can StudyBuddy help with case study analysis?",
      "answer": "Yes. Upload any case study and ask: 'Identify PESTLE factors', 'What HR theory applies?', or 'Evaluate the marketing strategy'. StudyBuddy breaks down the scenario, links it to theory, and shows you how to structure exam answers for full marks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I write 'recommendations' for evaluation questions?",
      "answer": "Structure: (1) Identify the problem from the case, (2) Apply relevant theory, (3) Evaluate options (pros/cons), (4) Recommend specific action with justification. Example: 'The company should implement job rotation (Herzberg's motivators) to reduce boredom and increase productivity.'"
